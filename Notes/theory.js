/*
Number: always floating point (not int or double)
String: simlar to java, can be used with single & double quotes (primitve, though)
Boolean: true or false, same as java
Undefined: not assigned a value yet, java
Null: same as 'empty value;
Symbol: unique val, cannot be changed
Big int: larger integers than a number can hold.
- we do not have to manually define the data type (different from java)


let: use for any variable
const: only for final values (e.g. birthYear)
var: old, don't use

- we can log more than one thing by seperating with a comma (console.log( , ))
- we can raise something to a power by ** (e.g 2 ** 3) is 2 cubed. 
- concatination works similar to java
- += & -= ... are the same as java
- ++i & i++ ... are the same
- similar >, <, >=, <= operators
- precedence rules are similar

- we can use ${variable} for concation of a string, it can be much faster than + "" ... etc. with back tickets (above tab) ``
- we can also use backticks for all string. Also somewhat similar newline \n\ feature, but instead we can use backticks. 
(e.g. console.log(`String 
with 
multiple 
lines`))

- similar if-else statments, and defining variables
- we can go from a String to a number using (Number(String)); this is similar to the parseInt(), parseDouble() commands in Java (and back to String, etc.)
- Type Conversion: can convert to a String, Number, Boolean
- NaN stands for not a number

- Type Coercion: happens when an operator is dealing with two different types
- + operator in console statments convert everything to a string if applicable to match the types.
- (-, *, /) operatiors in console statments convert everything to a number if applicable to match the types. Also, go from left to right.
    e.g. : let n = '1' + 1; // ('11', converts to a String)
    n = n - 1 // '11' = 1 = 10 (converts to a number)
