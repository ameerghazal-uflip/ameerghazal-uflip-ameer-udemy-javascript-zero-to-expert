// Section 7 Project 1

The application is allows the user to guess a number through a type and click. The user has 20 guesses, and with each incorrect guess, their score decreases by 1. Also, once the user guesses right, their high-score is saved and they're prompted to play again.

Coding Challenge #1
Implement a game rest functionality, so that the player can make a new guess!
Your tasks:

1. Select the element with the 'again' class and attach a click event handler.
2. In the handler function, restore initial values of the 'score' and 'secretNumber' variables.
3. Restore the initial conditions of the message, number, score, and guess input fields.
4. Also restore the original background color (#222) and number width (15rem
