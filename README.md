Add styling to the html code you created early to build your Idea Form.

Add additional styling to the html code you created early to build your Idea Form.

In the css file for the Idea Form

Add a line at the top to remove all padding and margin
Add box-sizing: border-box to your css file. This guarantees that the content box shrinks to make space for the padding and borders. Therefore, if you set your element width to 200 pixels, border-box makes sure that the content, padding, and borders fit in this number
Add 100px padding to the body of your html
Add top and bottom margin of 25px to the Idea paragraph
Add 10px padding to the form
Set the width of the form to 600px
Center align the Header text
Add 10px padding to the send button
Set the width of the button to 150px
Change the font size of the input fields to 16px
Change the padding on the input fields to 10px
Set the width of the input fields to 400px;
Change the font color of the paragraph header by using a child selector (ex #formid h1)
