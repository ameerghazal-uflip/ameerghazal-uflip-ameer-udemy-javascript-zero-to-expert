// Section 11 Project Bankist

The bankist application mirrors an ATM/bank like structure. The app features a money transfer, loan acceptance, and account an closer. This structure is similar to real life banks without the specifices, of course. So far, the application can sort transactions, keeps track of interest-withdrawals-deposits, and features a login mechanism (username, pin). With that said, the application is still being worked on an requires minor tweaks (idle timer, different curriencies, etc.)
