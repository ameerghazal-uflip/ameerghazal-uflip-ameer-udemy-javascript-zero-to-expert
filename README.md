// Section 7 Project 3 Pig Game

- Allow the user to guess a number 1-20. Inputs out of range or incorrect are either too high or too low. Also, if the score is under 1 (0), the user fails the challenge, prompted to try again. Modals come up for each attempt (high, low, 0, correct). The game functions the same way with a click and an enter key.
