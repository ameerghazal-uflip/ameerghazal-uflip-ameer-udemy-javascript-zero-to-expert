// Section 7 Project 3 Pig Game - Advanced Features

Orignial: 2-player game. Player 1 rolls the dice and choses when to hold his points. If either user holds their points, they get added to their total count and move to the next player. If either player rolls a 1, then their current points goes to 0 and it is the other players turn. The first player to 100 points wins.

Extra features: when a 1 OR a 5 is rolled, the score is reset to 0 and the player is switched. Modal is displayed which asks players what the MAX score instead of pre-set. The game begins by randonmly selecting which player goes first. Also, the game now displays the max score, while asking for the max score before the first game.
